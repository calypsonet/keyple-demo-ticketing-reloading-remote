# Keyple Reload Demo - Android Client's repository

This is the repository for the Android Client of the Keyple Reload Demo application.

This demo is an open source project provided by the [Calypso Networks Association](https://calypsonet.org) implementing
the [Eclipse Keyple SDK](https://keyple.org) in a typical use case that can serve as a basis for building a ticketing
ecosystem based on contactless cards and/or NFC smartphones.

The source code and APK are available at  [calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing-reloading-remote/releases](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing-reloading-remote/releases)

The code can be easily adapted to other cards, terminals and business logic.

It shows how to load contracts into a Calypso card, the whole ticketing process being managed remotely.
Following the contract loading the card can pay presented to a validator running the 
[Keyple Demo Validation](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing-validation-app) application and then checked with
the [Keyple Demo Control](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing-control-app) application.

Read the main [README](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-demo-ticketing-reloading-remote#readme) to understand the purpose of this
application.
